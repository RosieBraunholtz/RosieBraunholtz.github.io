  <h2>Work Experience </h2>
  <h3> Data Scientist at Actelligent</h3>
  <p>  I am currently doing an internship at FinTech start-up Actelligent. I am a data analyst, 
    specifically I work on gathering information from text using Natural Language Processing. I have vastly improved my
    knowledge of Python and I am comfortable with many Python packages and mmodules. I have also learnt about Machine Learning
    and AI and how they help in analysing data. I have shown initiative by starting side-projects while working here.
    I have gained a lot of knowledge and experience from this internship, however I am looking for a career more in line with
    my degree of astronomy.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3> Maths and Physics Tutor</h3>
  <p>I tutor A-level maths and physics as a part-time job on the side. I have
    multiple students and I design lessons based around their needs and
    find a way to communicate complex scientific ideas to them in a simple
    way. As well as this I am also a volunteer tutor with Glasgow ESOL
    forum, teaching English to non-native English speakers online once a
    week.</p>

  <br>
  <h3> English Teacher</h3>
  <p>I have been teaching English as a second language for the past 7 years as a summer and part-time job. This has given me very strong 
    communication and presentation skills and I have developed good teamwork and leadership traits as well. I enjoy teaching and sharing 
    knowledge to others as I find it very rewarding.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3> Customer service roles </h3>
  <p>I have experience in dealing with the public through customer service roles at Barnardoâ€™s and Pittordrie Football Club. During my time 
    in the latter I was promoted to Kiosk Manager where it was my responsibility to supervise, train others, and to handle the money at the 
    end of the shift. In both jobs I improved my people skills and I was engaging and attentive to members of the public.
