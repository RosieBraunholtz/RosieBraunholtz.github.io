  <h2>Work Experience </h2>

   <h3> Science Communicator at Kielder Observatory </h3>
  <h4> May 2023 - Present</h4>
  <p>  I am currently working as an astronomer and science communicator at Kielder Observatory. Kielder Observatory is an education and science commmunication
    charity whose aim is to teach the public about space and astronomy. Through my time working here I have gained invaluable knowledge on how to communicate and 
    present to an audience about difficult astronomy topics. Whether that be through engaging talks, conversation, blog posts, articles, podcasts, 
    video long-form content,  or video short-form content. I also now have an exellent knowledge of the night time sky and practical stargazing including 
    constellations hunting, how to use manual and robotic telescopes, and a basic knowledge of astrophotography through capturing images of deep-sky objects.

  <h3> Article Writer for SpaceCareers </h3>
  <h4> January 2023 - December 2024 </h4>

  <h3> Science Communicator at Edinburgh Science Festival </h3>
  <h4> Feb - April 2023 </h4>
  <p>  I took part in the Edinburgh Science Festival in the spring of 2023. My role was to teach young kids to code by using a robot they
    could give instructions to. It was a hectic but very fun experience and taught me a lot about science communication.

  <h3> Au pair in Madrid </h3>
  <h4> August - December 2023 </h4>
  <p>  For a few months I travelled to Madrid to work as an au pair looking after two kids of a Spanish family while taking Spanish classes during the day. 
    From my time there I was able to gain an intermediate level of Spanish.

  <h3> Data Scientist at Actelligent</h3>
  <h4>  December 2021 - May 2022 </h4>
  <p>  I completed a 6 month internship at FinTech start-up Actelligent, working as a data analyst.
    Specifically I worked on gathering information from text using Natural Language Processing. I vastly improved my
    knowledge of Python and I am now comfortable with many Python packages and modules. I have also learnt about Machine Learning
    and AI and how they help in analysing data.

  <h3> Maths and Physics Tutor</h3>
  <p> For the past few years I have tutored A-level maths and physics as a part-time job. I have
    multiple students and I design lessons based around their needs and
    find a way to communicate complex scientific ideas to them in a simple
    way. </p>

  <br>
  <h3> English Teacher</h3>
  <p>I have been teaching English as a second language for the past 10 years as a summer and part-time job. This has given me very strong 
    communication and presentation skills and I have developed good teamwork and leadership traits as well. I enjoy teaching and sharing 
    knowledge to others as I find it very rewarding. As well as this I also volunteer occasionaly with refugee centers.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3> Customer service roles </h3>
  <p>I have experience in dealing with the public through customer service roles at Barnardoâ€™s and Pittordrie Football Club. During my time 
    in the latter I was promoted to Kiosk Manager where it was my responsibility to supervise, train others, and to handle the money at the 
    end of the shift. In both jobs I improved my people skills and I was engaging and attentive to members of the public.
